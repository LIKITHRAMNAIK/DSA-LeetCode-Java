Hello, I'm Likith Ram Naik, a Computer Science and Engineering student at Lovely Professional University, Punjab. I'm originally from Andhra Pradesh and have a keen interest in problem-solving and web development.

I have worked on multiple projects, including full-stack web applications, and have a strong foundation in software development. I completed a Full-Stack Development program at Cipher Schools and have earned certifications in programming and data structures.

Apart from academics, I love playing badminton and watching movies, which help me stay active and refreshed. I also enjoy tackling coding challenges and have participated in competitions like HackVerse 2024, where I qualified for the final round.

Iâ€™m always eager to learn, take on new challenges, and collaborate with like-minded people!
